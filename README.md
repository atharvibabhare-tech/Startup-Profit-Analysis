**Project Overview**

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of startup financial data to understand how different types of expenditures influence profitability. The analysis examines the impact of R&D Spend, Marketing Spend, and Administration costs on Profit, along with state-wise comparisons.

The goal is to derive business insights using data visualization and statistical analysis.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset contains the following columns:

R&D_Spend – Investment in research and development

Administration – Administrative expenses

Marketing_Spend – Marketing and advertising costs

State – Location of the startup

Profit – Profit earned by the startup

**Tools & Libraries Used**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

**Analysis Performed**

Data loading and inspection

Missing value checks

Univariate analysis (distribution of variables)

Bivariate analysis (spend vs profit relationships)

State-wise profit and spending comparison

Correlation analysis using heatmaps

Multiple visualizations including bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps

**Key Visualizations**

Profit distribution

R&D Spend vs Profit

Marketing Spend vs Profit

Administration Spend vs Profit

State-wise average profit

Correlation matrix

**Insights**

R&D Spend shows a strong positive correlation with Profit.

Marketing Spend has a moderate impact on Profit.

Administration Spend has minimal influence on Profit.

Startups investing more in innovation tend to generate higher profits.

Profit patterns vary slightly across states but follow similar spending trends.

 **Conclusion**

The analysis indicates that R&D investment is the most significant driver of startup profitability. Businesses should prioritize innovation and product development over excessive administrative spending to maximize profit.

**Future Improvements**

Build a Linear Regression model for profit prediction

Feature scaling and model evaluation

Convert analysis into reusable Python classes (OOP)
